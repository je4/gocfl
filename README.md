# Go OCFL Implementation

This library supports the Oxford Common Filesystem Layout ([OCFL](https://ocfl.io/)) 
and focuses on creation, update, validation and extraction of ocfl StorageRoots and Objects.

## Why
There are several [OCFL tools & libraries](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki/Implementations#code-libraries-validators-and-other-tools) 
which already exists. 

### Container & I/O Performance

Serialization of an OCFL Storage Root into a container format like ZIP should be possible 
without much overhead on disk I/O. Therefor generation of an OCFL Container should be possible 
with one Read and one Write Task. Including checksums and compression (ZIP). Without deduplication
this library supports this functionality. 

### Extensions

Extensions described in the OCFL Standard are quite open in their functionality and can 
belong to [Storage Root](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#storage-root-extensions) or 
[Object](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#object-extensions). Since there's no specification of 
a generic extension api, it's hard to integrate specific extension hooks into other 
libraries. This library identifies 7 different hooks for extensions till now. 


## Functionality

- [x] Supports local filesystems
- [x] Supports S3 Cloud Storage (via [MinIO Client SDK](https://github.com/minio/minio-go))
- [ ] SFTP Storage
- [ ] Google Cloud Storage
- [x] storage root in ZIP files (native)
- [x] Supports mixing of source and target storage systems
- [x] Non blocking validation (does not stop on validation errors)
- [x] Support for OCFL v1.0 and v1.1
- [ ] Documentation for API
- [x] Digest Algorithms for Manifest: SHA512, SHA256
- [x] Fixity Algorithms: SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, BLAKE2b-160, BLAKE2b-256, BLAKE2b-384, BLAKE2b-512, MD5
- [x] Concurrent checksum generation on ingest/extract (multi-threaded)
- [x] minimized I/O (data is read and written only once on Object creation)
- [x] update strategy echo (incl. deletions) and contribute
- [x] deduplication (needs double read of all content files, switchable)
- [x] nearly full coverage of validation errors and warnings
- [x] content information
- [x] extraction with version selection
- [Community Extensions](https://github.com/OCFL/extensions) 
  - [ ] 0001-digest-algorithms

  - [x] NNNN-metafile (integration of one file into extension folder)
  - [ ] NNNN-indexer (technical metadata indexing) 
  - [x] NNNN-gocfl-extension-manager (initial extension for sorted exclusion and sorted execution)
